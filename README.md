New Python Project: Automated Data Cleaning Application

I recently built a Python application that helps in data preprocessing with just a few steps.

ðŸ”§ Key Features of the Application
âœ… Takes dataset path & name as input
âœ… Detects and removes duplicate records while keeping a copy of them
âœ… Handles missing values:

Numeric columns â†’ fills with mean

Non-numeric columns â†’ drops null records
âœ… Exports both clean dataset and duplicates dataset
âœ… Fully automated and reusable for any data

Pandas, NumPy

OpenPyXL, xlrd

This project strengthened my skills in data cleaning, preprocessing, and handling real-world data issues â€” which are crucial in Data Analysis, Data Science, and ETL pipelines.

It's take path and file name(Airbnb raw data)
And returns
  Clean data--Air_clean.csv
  Duplicate data--Air_Duplicates.csv
